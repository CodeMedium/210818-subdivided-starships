## Based on the cover of "Code as Creative Medium"

![A photo of the cover of "Code as Creative Medium"](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/89111078/129974545-346f8bf4-6f95-455b-9557-6ec06f6d8634.jpg)

The goal of this repo is to recreate an animated and interactive version of the cover for "[Code as Creative Medium](https://mitpress.mit.edu/books/code-creative-medium)". This cover was originally made by [Manolo Gamboa Naon](http://manoloide.com/) and was shared [for free in their repo](https://github.com/manoloide/AllSketchs).
